**Fiscal Multiplier: the Size of the Shock Matters** <br/>
&emsp; This paper presents a novel exploration into the impact of fiscal shock magnitude on the fiscal multiplier, challenging traditional views on non-linearity in fiscal policy analysis. It introduces a new empirical methodology, integrating local linear regression, to detect complex non-linear patterns in government spending multipliers. Through theoretical examination and simulation studies, the study demonstrates the significance of the shock's size in determining the multiplier's magnitude. Investigations into empirical outcomes using data from the United States are currently ongoing.
